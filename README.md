### Game created and built in 8 days

Game originally made for Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1, but unfortunately the game file metadata became corrupted 2 days before the end of the jam. 

### As such, this repo is for FOOL'S GOLD version 1.0, while the previous (corrupted) repo is for FOOL'S GOLD version 0.0.

### FOOL'S GOLD_v1.0 will be made in the _same way_ as v0.0. It will be exactly the same as the version I was on track to officially submit to the Game Jam. 

The only change, will be in the "polishing". I had a list of "polish for the MVP Game Jam submission", which I likely would've only completed partially before submission. However, since I have to rebuild the game seperate from the Game Jam, I'm going to include all of polish from that list. 

As such, this game was desigined and built in 8 "Game Jam days", instead of 7. ;)
